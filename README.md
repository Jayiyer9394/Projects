# UsedCarSales
Extracting insights from Used Car Sales Data of an Indian Automobile Company

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: 
Cleaned and preprocessed the raw used car sales data to remove any duplicates, missing values, and inconsistent formatting. The impact of this step is that it ensured the accuracy and completeness of the data, which in turn led to more reliable insights.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Conducted EDA on the cleaned data to identify trends, patterns, and relationships between variables. Used visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and box plots to gain insights into the distribution, correlation, and outliers of the data. The impact of this step is that it helped to identify key factors that affect used car sales and informed the subsequent modeling stage.

## Predictive Analysis: 
Employed regression analysis to develop a model that predicts the price of used cars based on the relevant variables identified during the exploratory data analysis phase. The impact of this step is that it provided valuable insights into the key factors that impact used car prices, enabling stakeholders to make more informed pricing decisions.

## Feature Importance and Interpretability: 
Conducted feature importance analysis and interpretability methods such as SHAP values to understand which variables had the most impact on the model's predictions. The impact of this step is that it provided insights into which features are most important to consider when pricing used cars, allowing for more informed decision-making.

## Data Processing and Visualization Tools: 
Utilized a combination of software tools such as MS SQL Server for data processing, Excel for data cleaning and manipulation, and Tableau for data visualization. The impact of this step is that it allowed for efficient processing of large datasets and effective visualization of the data, making it easier to communicate insights and findings to stakeholders.

## Presentation and Communication: 
Created visualizations and a report summarizing the insights and findings from the analysis. Communicated the results to stakeholders and made recommendations for action based on the insights gained. The impact of this step is that it enabled stakeholders to make data-driven decisions about their used car sales business, leading to improved efficiency, profitability, and customer satisfaction.
